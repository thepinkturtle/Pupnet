# Pupnet
This project will include a RPI, mcp3008 ADC IC, Electret Microphone Amplifier - MAX4466  from adafruit, all required breadboards
and wiring, and a USB webcam

Pupnet will take a picture of my puppy when he barks and email me the picture. This way I'll be alerted when he barks and I'm not
home.
